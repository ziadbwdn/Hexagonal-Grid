On Generating Hexagonal Grid From Scratch

Hey You All!

Top reminder at first, i will warn you it's not like your typical Portfolio at all. 
Instead it's more like a detour to my previous college period while taking Geological Engineering Major, such as GIS class, Geocomputation, and so on. 

And then, Since over the past 2 months, one of my friends asked me "is it true that an area of equilateral hexagon can be calculated if we know only the sides?" 
My quick answer at that time is.. "could be, but on what purpose?" then he showed me one of ArcMap tool to do just that, and asked myself what he needed at that time. 

As time goes, my curiosity blowing, asking to myself how to do this but from scratch, with programming language like python for example? 
Funnily enough, i just remembered this kind of feeling 2 years ago, when everybody in my workplace figuring out how to calculate volume from 3D model, but on each polygonal grid. 
Not that easy, obviously, let alone generating grid itself.

So, I did a quick search, an the result is there are too much ready-to-use library packages lying around instead of problem solving from scratch. 
And now, here we go, just one of little side project of mine on how to create hexagonal grid from scratch. 

The source code can be look into src, and later i will be updated the notebook because it is kind of outdated and messy

Oh yeah, another presentation slide would be nice, it have the animation on how the code works on the surface

At least we know that it's not like rocket science, as my university teacher said, sooner i will try to generate triangular grid. 

But stil, this is my pilot self-project

Enjoy!
